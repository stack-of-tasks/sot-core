/*! @ingroup factory
  \brief This singleton class keep tracks of all features and tasks.

  Three kinds of objects are handled:
  \li The controllers, i.e. the tasks which inherits from TaskAbstract.
  \li The features, i.e. the information which inherits from FeatureAbstract.

  \li Any object which need to be inside the SoT and which inherits from Entity.

  This class provides the necessary operations to register, unregister each
  instance of thoses classes.
  As tasks and features derived from Entities, they should be registered
  as such.

  \note From the code it is not very clear why we should not unregister
  from the tasks and the features...

  The role of this class is also to look for the object supporting
  a command, and to apply this command.

  It also returns references to signals from their fully-qualified names.
